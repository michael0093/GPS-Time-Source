DG1022Z measured directly using BNC cable without termination
LC29T measured using 10x probe. Output does not vary after GPS lock

Test DGT1022Z output with internal vs external source, generating 5MHz square: no observable difference on scope, no change to jitter which is well below 1ns.

Using NIX4 as the measurement reference on the DG1022Z
Internal = 32.767922  = -2.38ppm
External = 32.767907  = -2.84ppm  (delta 0.46ppm)
Internal = 32.7679237 = -2.328ppm
External = 32.7679063 = -2.859ppm (delta 0.531ppm)
